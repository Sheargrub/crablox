# crablox
crablox is a Rust-based tree-walk interpreter for the Lox language, heavily based on the implementation depicted in [Robert Nystrom's Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html).

### Running
Run crablox.exe from your CLI of choice: './crablox.exe \[?filename]'

If you opt not to include a file, you'll instead load into a repl dialog where you can freely test out code.

### Disclaimer
Please do not copy or use this code for your class projects! If you do, the aggrieved spirit of Bob Nystrom will come to your house and change all of your variable names to delicious-sounding breakfast entrees!

(Really, though - copying code from GitHub leaves you at severe risk of an academic misconduct violation, so please don't.)
